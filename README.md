# My `mousewheel.sh` Script

## Introduction

I created the `mousewheel.sh` script out of personal necessity. Navigating through Ubuntu, I found that the default mouse scroll speed just wasn't cutting it for me. It lacked that swift and efficient response I was longing for in my daily computing tasks.

## Why I Made This

- **A Quest for Speed**: I often found myself wishing for a quicker way to scroll through documents and web pages. This script was my solution to that, offering me, and now you, a chance to scroll at a pace that feels just right.

- **Ease and Consistency**: I didn't want to manually adjust my settings every time I turned on my computer. By setting this script to run automatically, I've ensured a consistent, fast-scrolling experience every time I use my machine.

## Behind the Scenes

What `mousewheel.sh` does is pretty straightforward. It tweaks a few system settings related to the mouse. When it runs, it changes these settings to give the mouse wheel that extra speed boost.

## How You Can Use It

If you want to give my script a spin:

1. First, make sure it's executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.local/share/Trash/files/mousewheel.sh
    ```

2. Then, run the script:

    ```bash
    sh ~/.local/share/Trash/files/mousewheel.sh
    ```

For details on how to set this up to run every time you start your system or open a terminal, I've included some instructions in another section of this README.

> **Personal Note**: Adjusting the mouse speed made a world of difference for me. Feel free to tweak the script if you feel the speed isn't quite right for you. Enjoy smoother scrolling!
